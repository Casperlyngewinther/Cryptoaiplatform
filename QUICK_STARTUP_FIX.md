# Quick Startup Fix for Network Issues

## üö® **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

Your application is experiencing network connectivity issues with some exchange sandbox endpoints. Here are the files I've fixed:

### **Files Updated:**

1. **`TradingService.js`** - Fixed method call issue for CryptoComExchange
2. **`CoinbaseExchange.js`** - Added proper error handling to prevent crashes

### **Copy These Fixed Files:**

You need to copy the following files from this workspace to your local project:

```bash
# Copy these files to your local project directory:
server/services/TradingService.js
server/services/CoinbaseExchange.js
```

### **Alternative: Start with Limited Exchanges**

To get your application running quickly, create a `.env` file with these settings:

```bash
# Add to your .env file
NODE_ENV=development
CRYPTO_COM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CRYPTO_COM_API_SECRET=your_secret_here

# Disable problematic exchanges temporarily
DISABLE_COINBASE=true
DISABLE_KUCOIN=true
DISABLE_BINANCE=true

# Keep working exchanges
ENABLE_BYBIT=true
ENABLE_KRAKEN=true
ENABLE_CRYPTOCOM=true
```

### **Quick Test Command:**

After copying the files, test with:

```bash
node server/index.js
```

The application should now start with at least 2-3 working exchanges instead of crashing.

## üîß **Root Causes Fixed:**

1. **Method mismatch**: CryptoComExchange uses `initialize()` not `connect()`
2. **Unhandled promise rejections**: WebSocket failures now handled gracefully
3. **DNS resolution failures**: Exchanges fail gracefully without crashing the app

## üìã **Expected Output:**

```
üåê Initializing ALL real exchange connections...
‚úÖ Bybit Exchange connected (TESTNET)
‚úÖ Kraken Exchange connected
‚úÖ Real exchange connections established: 2/6 exchanges connected
üí∞ Trading Service initialized
```

Your platform will work with the connected exchanges while others fail safely in the background.
