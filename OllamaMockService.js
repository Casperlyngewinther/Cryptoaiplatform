      explanation: `SUMMARY: Based on current market analysis, recommendation is to HOLD with 75% confidence due to mixed signals in sideways market conditions.

REASONING: The decision is based on multiple factors including technical indicators showing neutral momentum, volume analysis indicating reduced participation, and current market regime classification as sideways with low directional bias.

RISK_ASSESSMENT: Moderate risk level with primary concerns being potential false breakouts and low liquidity during current market hours. Position sizing should be conservative.

MARKET_CONTEXT: Market is currently range-bound between key support and resistance levels. No clear trend direction established, suggesting patience is warranted.

ALTERNATIVES: Could consider small position entry with tight stops, or wait for clearer directional signal above/below key levels.

CONFIDENCE: 7.5/10 - Decision supported by multiple indicators but market uncertainty limits conviction.`,

      patternDiscovery: `1. **Volatility Squeeze Pattern**: Market shows recurring periods of low volatility followed by explosive moves. Best performance in 65% of cases when combined with volume expansion.

2. **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Opportunities**: Price differences between major exchanges create profit windows lasting 15-45 seconds. Success rate: 78% with proper execution.

3. **News-Momentum Correlation**: Strong positive correlation (0.73) between major news releases and price movements within 30 minutes. Risk factor: fake news and market manipulation.

4. **Weekend Effect**: Systematic lower volatility on weekends with trend continuations on Monday open. Implementation complexity: Medium, requires 24/7 monitoring.`,

      riskNarrative: `Current portfolio risk assessment indicates MODERATE exposure with several key factors requiring attention:

**Primary Risk Factors:**
- Portfolio concentration in top 3 positions (68% of total value)
- Increased correlation between major holdings during market stress
- Leverage ratio approaching upper management limits

**Market-Specific Risks:**
- High volatility environment increases execution risk
- Liquidity concerns in smaller cap positions
- Regulatory uncertainty in emerging markets segment

**Recommendations:**
1. Reduce position concentration through strategic rebalancing
2. Implement additional hedging for correlated positions
3. Monitor leverage ratios closely and consider reduction
4. Increase cash reserves for upcoming market volatility`,

      marketAnalysis: `**Current Market Regime**: SIDEWAYS_MARKET with elevated volatility

**Key Market Drivers:**
- Central bank policy uncertainty driving defensive positioning
- Institutional rotation from growth to value sectors
- Geopolitical tensions affecting risk sentiment
- Technical levels providing strong support/resistance

**Sentiment Analysis**: NEUTRAL with slight bearish bias. Institutional flows show risk-off behavior while retail sentiment remains optimistic.

**Short-term Outlook**: Range-bound trading expected with potential breakout catalyst from upcoming economic data releases. Key levels: Support at $42,150, Resistance at $45,800.

**Medium-term Outlook**: Structural trends favor continued volatility with potential trend establishment after policy clarity emerges.`,
