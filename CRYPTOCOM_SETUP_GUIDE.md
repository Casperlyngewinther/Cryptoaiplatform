# Crypto.com Exchange API Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This document provides setup instructions for the new Crypto.com Exchange API integration, implementing "Fase 2" of the Blueprint for Perfection - moving from simulation to real-world exchange connectivity.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Variables
Create or update your `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Crypto.com Exchange API Configuration
CRYPTO_COM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CRYPTO_COM_API_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

# Environment Settings
NODE_ENV=development  # Use 'production' for live trading
```

### 2. API Key Generation
To obtain your Crypto.com Exchange API credentials:

1. Visit [Crypto.com Exchange](https://crypto.com/exchange)
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to `User Center` ‚Üí `API`
4. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions:
   - ‚úÖ Read account information
   - ‚úÖ Place orders
   - ‚úÖ Cancel orders
   - ‚úÖ Access trading history

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never share your API secret
- Use IP whitelisting for additional security
- Start with sandbox/test environment
- Use minimal permissions initially

### 3. Installation & Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Run the Crypto.com integration tests
node test_cryptocom_integration.js
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Real Exchange Integration
The integration follows the "Verificerbarhed F√∏rst" (Verifiability First) philosophy:

- **Antifragile Design**: Circuit breaker pattern handles API failures gracefully
- **Smart Order Routing**: Automatically routes orders between simulation and real exchange
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Crypto.com's API rate limits
- **WebSocket Streams**: Real-time market data and order updates
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and fallback mechanisms

### Service Structure
```
CryptoComExchange.js     # Main exchange service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REST API Client      # HTTP requests to Crypto.com
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebSocket Manager    # Real-time data streams
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Order Management     # Order placement and tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Market Data Handler  # Price feeds and order books
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Circuit Breaker      # Error handling and recovery
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### Test Mode vs Production Mode
The integration supports multiple operational modes:

#### Development/Test Mode (Default)
```javascript
// Uses mock data and simulation
const exchange = new CryptoComExchange({
  testMode: true,
  sandbox: true
});
```

#### Sandbox Mode
```javascript
// Uses Crypto.com's sandbox environment
const exchange = new CryptoComExchange({
  testMode: false,
  sandbox: true
});
```

#### Production Mode
```javascript
// Uses live Crypto.com API
const exchange = new CryptoComExchange({
  testMode: false,
  sandbox: false
});
```

### Order Routing Logic
Orders are intelligently routed based on:

1. **Exchange Health**: Real exchange must be connected and healthy
2. **Symbol Support**: Only supported trading pairs go to real exchange
3. **Order Size**: Minimum order value threshold ($10)
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Falls back to simulation if exchange is down

## üìä API Endpoints

### Exchange Status
```http
GET /api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/status
```
Returns connection status, authentication state, and circuit breaker status.

### Market Data
```http
GET /api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/market-data
GET /api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/market-data/{symbol}
```
Retrieves real-time market data from Crypto.com.

### Account Balance
```http
GET /api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/balance
```
Gets current account balances from Crypto.com.

### Place Order
```http
POST /api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/order
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "symbol": "BTC_USDT",
  "side": "buy",
  "type": "limit",
  "quantity": "0.01",
  "price": "45000"
}
```

### Combined Real Exchange Data
```http
GET /api/v2/exchange/all-real-data
```
Returns comprehensive status of all real exchange connections.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Rate Limiting Settings
```javascript
// Default rate limits (per Crypto.com API documentation)
rateLimiters: {
  orders: { max: 15, window: 100 },      // 15 orders per 100ms
  general: { max: 30, window: 100 },     // 30 general requests per 100ms
  market: { max: 100, window: 1000 }     // 100 market data requests per second
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```javascript
circuitBreaker: {
  failures: 5,          // Open after 5 failures
  resetTimeout: 60000   // Reset after 1 minute
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Integration Tests
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
node test_cryptocom_integration.js
```

The test suite covers:
- ‚úÖ Server connectivity
- ‚úÖ Exchange status and health
- ‚úÖ Market data access
- ‚úÖ Order routing logic
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connectivity
- ‚úÖ V2.0 platform integration

### Manual Testing
You can also test individual components:

```javascript
// Test market data
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/market-data');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);

// Test exchange status
const status = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/status');
const statusData = await status.json();
console.log(statusData);
```

## üö® Security Best Practices

### API Key Security
- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement IP whitelisting when possible
- Monitor for unusual trading patterns
- Set up alerts for large orders or rapid trading

### Error Monitoring
- Log all API errors and responses
- Set up alerts for circuit breaker activations
- Monitor rate limit usage
- Track order execution success rates

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Exchange connection uptime
- Order execution success rate
- API response times
- Rate limit usage
- Circuit breaker activations
- WebSocket connection stability

### Health Check Endpoints
```http
GET /api/health                                    # Overall system health
GET /api/v2/exchange/cryptocom/status              # CryptoCom specific status
GET /api/v2/exchange/all-real-data                 # All real exchange data
```

## üîÑ Deployment Checklist

- Ensure API keys have correct permissions

#### "Circuit breaker is open" Error
- Check Crypto.com API status
- Review error logs for underlying API issues
- Wait for circuit breaker reset (60 seconds default)

#### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Verify network connectivity
- Check firewall settings
- Review WebSocket endpoint URLs for sandbox vs production

#### Order Routing Issues
- Check order size meets minimum requirements
- Verify symbol is supported on CryptoCom
- Ensure exchange is connected and authenticated
